Located in central Albania, Berat bears witness to the coexistence of various religious and cultural communities down the centuries. It features a castle, locally known as the Kala, most of which was built in the 13th century, although its origins date back to the 4th century BC. The citadel area numbers many Byzantine churches, mainly from the 13th century, as well as several mosques built under the Ottoman era which&nbsp;began&nbsp;in 1417. Gjirokastra, in the Drinos river valley in southern Albania, features a series of outstanding two-story&nbsp;houses which were developed in the 17th century. The town also retains a bazaar, an 18th-century mosque and two churches of the same period. | nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |             2005 |              2008 |        0 |        nan | nan           |    20.1333  |    40.0694 |          58.9   | (iii)(iv)            | C                | al         | alb         |               0 |\n",
